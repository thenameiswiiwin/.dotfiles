# .dotfiles

**My personal dotfiles, rewritten in Lua**

This repository contains my personal configuration files (“dotfiles”) for various tools and applications. I’ve migrated and rewritten much of my configuration logic into Lua for better readability, flexibility, and performance. It covers setups for my terminal, editor, shell, and several other utilities.

## Overview

This repository is a curated collection of configurations for my daily development environment. The files here let me quickly set up a system with my preferred settings, aliases, and themes. Most of the logic has been reworked in Lua, especially where performance and clarity are needed (for example, in my [Neovim](https://neovim.io) configuration).

---

## Features

- **Shell Enhancements:** Custom aliases, Zsh configurations, and history management.
- **Editor Setup:** A Lua-powered Neovim configuration with custom plugins and performance tweaks.
- **Terminal Customization:** Configurations for terminal emulators like [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) and [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/).
- **Productivity Tools:** Setup for tools like lazygit, btop, and starship prompt.
- **Keyboard Firmware:** Configuration files for my Lily58 keyboard running QMK firmware.
- **Cross-Platform:** Although tailored to my personal workflow, many configurations can be adapted for other systems.

## Repository Structure

Below is an overview of the folders and their purposes:

- **aliases**
  Contains shell aliases that help speed up command-line workflows.

- **atuin/**
  Configuration for [Atuin](https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin), a modern shell history tool.

- **bin/**
  Personal scripts and executable tools that supplement daily operations.

- **btop/**
  Custom configuration files for [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop) – a resource monitor.

- **fonts/**
  Fonts and related assets used across various applications.

- **gh/**
  Settings for the GitHub CLI, ensuring a streamlined GitHub experience.

- **hushlogin**
  A file to suppress the standard system login message for a cleaner terminal start.

- **keyboard/**
  QMK firmware configuration for the Lily58 keyboard, including custom keymaps.

- **kitty/**
  Configuration for the [kitty terminal emulator](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/).

- **lazygit/**
  Configurations for [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), a simple terminal UI for git.

- **nvim/**
  Neovim configuration rewritten in Lua – this is the heart of the editor customization.

- **rectangle**
  Settings for window management (or other rectangle-based utilities).

- **scripts/**
  Miscellaneous scripts that automate various tasks.

- **starship/**
  Configuration for [Starship](https://starship.rs/), a customizable prompt for your shell.

- **tmux/**
  Tmux configuration files to manage terminal multiplexing efficiently.

- **wezterm/**
  Settings for [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/), another terminal emulator option.

- **zsh/**
  Zsh shell configuration and plugins for an enhanced command-line experience.

- **.gitignore & .stow-global-ignore**
  Files to exclude specific files from git tracking and stow, respectively.

- **Brewfile**
  A list of Homebrew packages to install on macOS (or Linux using Homebrew) for dependencies and utilities.

- **install.sh**
  A shell script that bootstraps the dotfiles installation. This script typically leverages GNU Stow to symlink configuration files into the proper locations.

---

## Installation

To install these dotfiles on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thenameiswiiwin/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
   cd ~/.dotfiles
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   - Ensure that [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is installed.
   - On macOS, install Homebrew packages using the provided Brewfile:

     ```bash
     brew bundle --file=Brewfile
     ```

   - Install any other required dependencies (such as Lua, Neovim, etc.) as per your system.

3. **Run the Installation Script**

   Execute the installation script to create symlinks in your home directory:

   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

   The script uses GNU Stow to link the configuration folders (for example, `stow nvim` for Neovim or `stow zsh` for Zsh).

4. **Restart or Reload Your Shell**

   After installation, restart your terminal or source your shell configuration to apply changes.

## Usage

Once installed, your development environment should automatically load the configured settings. Here are a few tips:

- **Updating Dotfiles:**
  If you make changes to any configuration file, simply re-run the installation script or use GNU Stow commands to update the symlinks.

- **Module-specific Commands:**
  For individual modules (like `nvim` or `tmux`), you can navigate to their directories and update settings as needed. The Lua-based configuration for Neovim is modular, so you can add or remove plugins easily.

- **Customization:**
  Almost every component in this repository is customizable. For instance, you can edit the Zsh configuration or modify your personal aliases without affecting other setups.

---

## Customization

Feel free to fork and modify this repository to suit your personal preferences. Some areas you might consider tweaking include:

- **Aliases:**
  Modify or add new aliases in the `aliases` file.

- **Neovim Config:**
  The `nvim` directory contains a Lua-based setup. Customize your plugins or settings in the `init.lua` and accompanying module files.

- **Terminal Settings:**
  Adjust the configurations for your terminal emulators (kitty, wezterm) according to your preferred themes and settings.

---

## Dependencies

- **GNU Stow:** For managing symlinks.
- **Neovim:** With Lua support for editor configuration.
- **Zsh:** Or your shell of choice (with appropriate configurations).
- **Homebrew:** For managing packages (if on macOS or Linux with Linuxbrew).
- **Other utilities:** Refer to the Brewfile for a list of required packages and tools.
